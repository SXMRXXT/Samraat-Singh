# Samraat-Singh
Jainendra Gautam (born April 17, 1997), known professionally as SAMRAAT (stylized as SXMRXXT), is an Indian rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. His music blends experimental hip-hop, cloud rap, and alternative R&B. It is often shaped by distorted textures, stream-of-consciousness lyricism, and unpredictable sound design.

Influenced by artists such as Playboi Carti, JPEGMAFIA, Lucki, and Kanye West’s Yeezus‑era experimentation, SXMRXXT’s work explores the space between glitch-heavy aggression and emotional vulnerability. Projects including Mr. Producer, ALWAYS, and with love we built demonstrate his ability to shift between raw sonic chaos and reflective, melodic arrangements.

As a writer, SXMRXXT has made a significant mark under different personas. Writing as Samraat Singh, he authored the critically acclaimed A Death Day Saga, a deeply resonant series exploring love, betrayal, and existentialism. Under the name DoDo, he penned Rap Genesis, a poetic masterpiece bridging hip-hop and introspection. His thought-provoking work Nothing Is Official bears his SXMRXXT moniker, further cementing his status as a multidimensional creator.

SXMRXXT approaches music and writing as a form of world-building. His discography forms an evolving narrative in which each track serves as an emotional and conceptual chapter. His art serves as a powerful testament to the boundless possibilities of creative expression, offering a space where every word and beat is a journey into the extraordinary, inviting all to discover new dimensions within themselves and the world around them. SXMRXXT’s artistry is more than entertainment; it’s an exploration of identity, society, and the human experience.

His catalog is released under TRMS (The Real Me Studios), an independent imprint founded by SXMRXXT to house his avant-garde work across music and literature, operating under the creative collective SAMPIRE.
